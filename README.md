# Inverted Pendulum Control Using State Feedback

This project demonstrates the use of state feedback control to stabilize an inverted pendulum system. The model is based on the dynamic equations of motion and simulated in Python.

## Features
- Models the dynamics of an inverted pendulum on a cart.
- Implements state-space representation and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).
- Simulates the system's behavior and visualizes results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy & SciPy**: For linear algebra and simulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization.

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
